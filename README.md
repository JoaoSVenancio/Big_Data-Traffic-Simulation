# Big_Data-Traffic-Simulation
This repository contains Python code related to the "Big Data" project within the scope of the Bioinformatics Bachelor's degree. The objective is to simulate traffic at a street intersection, where cars move in random directions. Each car is represented by a thread. The system includes a semaphore mechanism that coordinates the passage of cars, considering conditions such as heavy traffic and breakdowns. The code logs the state of cars, movements at the intersection, and detailed reports for possible competitive conditions. Additionally, variable movement and wait times are simulated to make the simulation more realistic.
